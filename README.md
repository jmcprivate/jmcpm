# Install.sh installation guide
This is ONLY for myself. To install a basic environment for development. 

## Step 1: Download this repo:

`wget https://github.com/jmcprivate/jmcpm/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -O jmcpm.zip`

Unzip:

`unzip jmcpm.zip`

Go into the directory:

`cd jmcpm-main`


## Step 2: Make the File Executable

If your .sh file isn't already executable, you'll need to give it execute permissions. You can do this with the chmod command:


`chmod +x install.sh`


## Step 3: Run the Script

Now you can run the script by typing:

`./install.sh`

If the script requires sudo (root) privileges, you can run it with:

`sudo ./install.sh`
